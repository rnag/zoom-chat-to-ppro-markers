# Zoom Chat to PPro Markers

> Import a Zoom .chat File for Meeting as Sequence Markers into Adobe Premiere Pro

## Getting Started

Steps to get this working in Adobe Premiere:

1. Use following link to download `JSX Launcher` Extension:
   https://adobe.com/go/cc_plugins_discover_plugin?pluginId=12096&workflow=share

2. Download this `.jsx` file and save it to a local user folder.

3. Open Extension in Premiere, Choose `Select Script Folder...` and select the folder where `.jsx` file was downloaded to.

4. Open or create new Premiere Project.

5. Drag any media file into the timeline. The folder with the media file should contain the `*.chat` file to import sequence markers for.

6. Ensure there is an ACTIVE sequence -- usually there should be one by default.

7. Run the Script. Chat Markers should be added automatically to the Sequence in Premiere.
